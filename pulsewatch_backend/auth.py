"""User accounts, password hashing, and enrollment codes for PulseWatch.

Storage is a small local SQLite file (users.db) — no external DB service
required. Patients never self-register: a researcher generates a one-time
enrollment code (which also mints a fresh, unguessable patient_id), the
patient claims it once from the app to set their own password, and logs
in with username/password after that.
