/// Android 12+'s Doze can defer or drop connections outright even with a
/// foreground service running, foreground services don't reliably survive
/// the app being swiped from Recents, and OEM battery managers (Samsung's

/// the app is. A short, bounded, periodic sync sidesteps all of that: each
/// run is a few seconds to a couple of minutes, so it isn't fighting Doze
/// the way an always-on connection is, and WorkManager itself persists its
/// schedule across process death and device reboots (see
/// RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED in AndroidManifest.xml, which is what lets it
/// reschedule after a reboot).

/// lose any, the same way the interactive path already couldn't (see
