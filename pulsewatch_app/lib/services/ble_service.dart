  // connection modes (see bluetooth_device.dart's connect()/connectionState
  // doc comments) — this isn't a minor flag:
  //   - false (default): a direct connection. connect() only resolves once
  //     actually connected (or the timeout fires). Used for the manual
  //     "user tapped a device they just scanned, it's in range right now"
  //     flow in device_screen.dart, where we want fast, definite feedback.
  //   - true: hands reconnection off to the OS's Bluetooth stack, which
  //     keeps retrying in the background whenever the device comes back
  //     into range, instead of us having to actively re-scan. The tradeoff
  //     (per flutter_blue_plus) is that connect() then always returns
  //     immediately regardless of whether a connection has actually been
  //     established — so we can't assume "connected" just because connect()
  //     resolved, and instead wait on connectionState ourselves below. Used
  //     for tryAutoReconnect(), where the watch may not be in range yet.
  //
  // [awaitSync] controls whether this call waits for syncDataFromWatch() to
  // finish before returning:
  //   - false (default, interactive callers): fire-and-forget. device_screen
  //     shows a blocking "connecting…" spinner keyed to this function's
  //     return, and a backlog sync can take a while — it shouldn't hold
  //     that up. Progress is still observable via transferProgressStream.
  //   - true (background_sync_service.dart only): the WorkManager task needs
  //     a definite "are we done yet" signal so it knows when it's safe to
  //     disconnect and hand a result back to WorkManager (whose own
  //     retry/backoff depends on that result being accurate) — see
  //     performBackgroundSync().
  //
  // [loggedAs] tags every SyncLogService entry this call produces so the
  // in-app diagnostics view (device_screen.dart) can distinguish "the user
  // was watching this fail live" from "this failed unattended overnight".
  //
  // Each stage below (BLE connect, characteristic discovery, sync,
  // foreground service) is caught and logged separately rather than behind
  // one umbrella try/catch. That matters for two reasons: (1) a failure in
  // the foreground service or the sync step must NOT be reported as
  // "connection failed" when the BLE link itself is genuinely up — the old
  // single catch-all conflated those, so a foreground-service hiccup showed
  // the user the exact same generic error as a real failed pairing, and
  // (2) SyncLogService.lastFailure() can then show a message that actually
  // names what broke instead of a raw, undifferentiated exception string.

  ///     isn't already handled at the data layer.
  ///   - The one real cost of not skipping: if an *interactive* session
  ///     genuinely has a healthy connection open right now, this cycle's
